Themed gif loader using the GIPHY API

I gave it a light video game theme, but it can load any kind of gif searching the term.

Text entries create a new button with the associated data object.

Clicking the button queries the Giphy API for relevant gifs and returns static gifs that animate with a click. Also added a button link for fullsize viewing.

Enjoy!
